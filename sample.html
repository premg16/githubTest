            Basic Tools and Software for Web Development

    Computer & OS: You can’t write code without a computer and OS running on it. To learn web development you don’t need any kind of fancy computer (If you have it’s good…). You can use any kind of mid-range laptop or desktop. For the operating system, you can use MacOS, Windows (Latest version) or Linux whatever is comfortable for you.
    Text Editor / IDE: No doubt VSCode is good for most cases and most languages. It has good performance, great extensions, built in terminal and ton of features as well. In 2019 StackOverFlow survey VSCode was developers first preference as well. You also have some other good options such as Sublime Text or Atom. If we talk about IDEs so Visual Studio (ASP.net or C#), Eclipse and Netbeans (Java). are good options.
    Web Browser: Most of developers first choice is either Chrome or Firefox. Chrome is fast and it uses V8 engine (JavaScript engine). Firefox has also come a long way and some of it’s good stuff is not in chrome browser. Both the browsers have fantastic dev-tools to to troubleshoot the issues in web development.
    Terminal: You will be working a lot with CLI using some system commands. You can use the default or third-party terminal for your web development project. Bash, Zsh, Powershell, Git Bash, iTerm, Hyper these all are options available to use.
    Design (Optional): Not everbody needs to learn this. In companies there is a specific team to make images, logo or sketches but if you are working as a freelancer then you may have to learn Adobe XD, Photoshop, Sketch or Figma.
